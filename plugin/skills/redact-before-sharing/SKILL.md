description: Permanently black out personal data in a PDF, scan, photo or screenshot before it is sent, filed, published or attached.

# Redact a document before it leaves

## 1. Run the redaction

Call `redact_pdf_and_wait` with `file_path` set to the user's PDF, JPEG or PNG. Pass photos and screenshots as they are; don't convert them to PDF first. If the user only wants to share the result and not have you read it, don't open the original either: pass the path.

Narrow it only when the user asks to:

- `pii_categories`: only these kinds of data (for example only `Person` and `Email`).
- `pii_included_terms`: extra words to always black out, such as a project code name.
- `pii_excluded_terms`: words to keep visible, such as the user's own company name.

For a folder, start one `redact_pdf` job per file, then collect each with `get_job_status` and `download_redacted`. Don't upload the same file twice. If a call times out, the job keeps running: poll `get_job_status` with the `job_id`.

If there is no API key, call `try_demo` with the same `file_path` to redact the first page for free, then tell the user a free account gets its first document (up to 5 pages) done in full.

## 2. Report back

Give the user `output_path` (by default `<name>-redacted.pdf` next to the original, which is left unchanged) and the page count.

Tell them the redacted text is deleted from the file, not hidden under a black box, so it can't be copied out or recovered. Automatic detection can still miss something, so for a filing or anything public they should look through the redacted PDF before sending it. They can add or remove boxes in the Studio at redact-pdf.ai.

If the user wants the document to stay readable, with "who did what" still clear, use the anonymize-before-ai skill instead. Black boxes lose who did what; `[Person 1]` tags keep it.
